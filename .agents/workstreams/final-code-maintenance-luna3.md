# Workstream: final-code-maintenance-luna3

- Agent identity: Codex | GPT-5.6 Luna | Windows desktop
- Agent: /root/final_maintenance_luna3
- Branch: `codex/stage5-wechat-ilink-hardening`
- Status: done
- Start/end: 2026-08-27 -> 2026-08-27
- Scope: Final maintenance review of session authorization, public facade budgets/exports, inbound bounds, compatibility, and release documentation.
- Plan: baseline and preserve existing public facade edit; verify Control Core overlay wiring; repair facade budget/disposal and export contract as evidenced by tests; audit inbound/callback and compatibility residuals; reconcile docs; run focused and required full validation.
- Owned files: `src/public.mjs`, related focused tests, package export/docs updates required by this slice, this workstream, and final handoff documentation.
- Do not touch: public repository, package version, unrelated active workstream-owned source without evidence.
- Validation: focused tests; `npm test`; release guard; channel matrix check; syntax check; `git diff --check`; `npm pack --dry-run --json`.
- Adversarial review: challenge source/budget bypass, queued work after dispose, callback capacity/fail-closed behavior, export leakage, and stale documentation claims.
- Handoff: Completed A3/A4 public facade hardening (`96f019a`), A5 callback-reference/reply-throttle bounds (`649be45`), and A6 package export narrowing (`b154536`). Added focused tests for budgets, queue/disposal races, callback capacity, and package exports. Full validation: `npm test` 1346 total (1345 pass + 1 skip), release guard remains published-contract 909, channel matrix/syntax/diff checks pass, and `npm pack --dry-run --json` is pending final capture. Real-device/provider and host isolation validation remain declared risks.
