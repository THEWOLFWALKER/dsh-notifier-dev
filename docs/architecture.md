# Architecture

## Product And UX Contract

The system is designed around the user's task, not around an internal feature inventory. A new capability should reduce user effort, make state and failure understandable, and remain safe under interruption or partial availability. Prefer progressive disclosure, sensible defaults, explicit status, reversible actions, and actionable errors. Rich functionality is welcome when it composes cleanly with existing flows; complexity that cannot be explained or maintained is a design defect.

All implementation work follows a written plan and an adversarial review loop: plan the smallest useful slice, implement it, challenge assumptions and failure paths, revise the code, then validate focused behavior and the full contract. Long-range roadmap items stay staged and evidence-driven; do not build speculative infrastructure ahead of a demonstrated need.

The sub-agent console and any admin-facing GUI are part of DSH, not a separate product. They must reuse the visual tokens, density, navigation, feedback states, responsive behavior, and interaction grammar already established in `src/admin/ui.mjs`. New screens may add domain-specific information architecture, but they must not create a competing visual language or decorative dashboard style.

The approved future product direction is documented in `docs/architecture-roadmap.md`: a personal-mode-first cross-IM control plane with a unified control core and native channel renderers. That roadmap is planning state only; current runtime behavior remains defined by `src/` and tests.

## Runtime Shape

`src/index.mjs` is the Cordis plugin assembly root. It resolves configuration, creates the shared state store, overlays admin-managed credentials when enabled, builds the notifier, and then wires optional services. Pure "decision" stages of assembly — the outbound credential overlay, the admin token strategy, and the six-channel inbound enable signals — live as documented in `src/assembly/*.mjs` (`outbound.mjs`, `admin-token.mjs`, `inbound-signals.mjs`); `index.mjs` calls them and wires the results in place. The actions/approval/questions interaction lifecycles share one state ledger (`src/interaction/ledger.mjs`, `createInteractionLedger`) with decision-field names preserved per chain (`outcome` vs `decision`); per-chain `latestPendingFor` heuristics stay local. Inbound content normalizes to a unified text/image/file shape via `src/inbound/message.mjs` (`normalizeInboundMessage`, text-compatible); the WeChat iLink provider is isolated under `src/channels/wechat-ilink/` and enters through a compatibility facade, with account-scoped cursor/context state and protocol evidence labels. The QQ single-chat image parse interface (`parseQQImageMessage`) is fixture-tested but intentionally not wired until real-device protocol evidence exists. Disposal is collected and executed in reverse assembly order.

```text
Cordis context
  -> config.mjs
  -> store / ledger / routing registry
  -> src/assembly/*.mjs (outbound credential overlay, admin token, inbound enable signals)
  -> createNotifier (adapters + level routing + segmentation + retry)
  -> event-listener (automatic events + turn tracker)
  -> tools (notify, notify_test, ask_user)
  -> inbound identity/pairing/bus/token stack
  -> approval/actions/questions/conversation bridges
  -> admin API/UI/SSE and scan handlers
```

## Outbound Flow

1. `resolveConfig()` validates rows, resolves `${ENV:NAME}`, and skips invalid channels without aborting startup.
2. `createNotifier()` normalizes messages and resolves level routing.
3. `routeTargets()` selects enabled channel instances; optional agent/session routing filters the result.
4. `sendSegmented()` splits long Unicode text. A partial segmented failure is marked `noRetry` so already delivered pieces are not replayed.
5. Retry policy is level-dependent: time-sensitive retries most, active retries once, passive does not retry by default.
6. Broadcast outcomes feed the ledger, admin event hub, and optional `dsh-notifier/sent` emission independently.

## Inbound Trust Flow

```text
provider payload
  -> normalizeInbound / channel-specific authentication
  -> inbound bus deduplication
  -> identity allows(channel, userId)
  -> command / approval / question / conversation consumer
  -> token or trusted reply validation
  -> first-arrival settlement
  -> agent action or desktop fallback
```

The empty identity table is a guided bootstrap state: registration commands remain available, while normal business messages remain denied until pairing succeeds. Pairing codes are hashed, short-lived, rate-limited, and auditable. The guided bootstrap code is delivered through `<stateDir>/bootstrap-paircode.txt` (mode `0600`, rewritten on re-mint, deleted as soon as the code is redeemed/expired/revoked or the instance boots outside the guided state); logs and stderr carry only the file path, never the code itself. Failed pairing attempts — including submissions of an already expired code — count toward the per-`(channel, userId)` lockout, so an expired code cannot be used to pump unlimited re-mints. Callback/action/question tokens are single-use and source-scoped when a source chat is recorded. Source scoping is fail-closed on the click side since 2026-08-24 (batch C1 / P1-4): when a Telegram short reference carries an origin chat, or a Feishu card value carries `srcChat`, a callback whose own chat id cannot be read (deleted message, malformed payload, missing `context.open_chat_id`) is rejected with "go back to the original chat" instead of being allowed through. The reference is not consumed and the waiter is not settled, so the original card stays usable inside its TTL. Cards minted before the metadata existed (no origin / empty `srcChat`) keep the legacy warn-and-allow path, bounded by the 15-minute reference TTL.

Question numbered fallbacks carry target-scoped `hintTargets` records. A reply can settle only when `(channel,userId,chatId)` exactly matches a pushed card or a confirmed per-target `sendText`; a same-user wrong-chat reply is consumed with an instruction to return to the original chat and does not settle. Missing `chatId`, legacy channel-only `hintChannels`, cross-channel messages, and unconfirmed/partial delivery remain fail-closed. A channel-level `notifyAll().delivered` result is intentionally insufficient to establish a specific chat's receipt.

## Routing

Outbound resolution layers are, in order: session diff, exact agent id, workspace entry, global enabled channel pool. `channels` and `quiet` are resolved independently. Inbound resolution uses explicit conversation binding, channel default, unique active agent, then latest active session.

Persistent route keys are `route:agents`, `route:channels`, `route:sessions`, and `bind:*` compatibility records. The route CLI and admin API use the same router setters; they must not write these tables directly.

## State And Files

The shared file is `<stateDir>/state.json` (default `$DSH_HOME/dsh-notifier/state.json`, then `~/.dsh/dsh-notifier/state.json`). The store uses dirty-key merge, a lock file, mtime convergence reads, 0600 best effort permissions, and corruption backup before self-healing.

Other durable files include `ledger.jsonl`, `ledger-state.json`, and `admin-audit.jsonl` in the same state directory when those features are enabled. Credentials are masked in admin responses and must never be copied into docs, tests, or logs.

Every state key family and every in-process learning table must have a bound and a reclamation path. Persistent families are reclaimed by the `sweepOnce` pass in `src/index.mjs` (dedup window, resolved approvals/actions/questions, orphan pending rows, observe-mode retention) or by their owner's lifecycle (`bind:*` follows session-registry reclamation, `wechat:<accountId>:ctx:` caps at 256 uids; legacy `wechat:ctx:` remains for compatibility callers). In-process tables use `src/inbound/_bounded.mjs`: `setBounded` evicts the oldest entry past the cap and refreshes an updated key's freshness (LRU touch), and `createThrottledWarn` keeps eviction visible without flooding logs. Current caps are 1024 for the dingtalk (`sessionWebhooks`, `chatSenders`, `seenMsgIds`) and qq (`targetKinds`, `msgSeqs`) tables, and 256 in-flight keys for the debounce and grace queues, which fire the oldest entry early rather than dropping it. Eviction must always degrade into an existing fallback path, never into a lost notification.

## Admin Boundary

The server is a zero-dependency `node:http` wrapper around `admin/api.mjs`. It is loopback-only, requires `Authorization: Bearer`, caps request bodies at 1 MiB, caps SSE connections, and maps business errors to safe status/message responses. The UI is embedded in `src/admin/ui.mjs`; the API and CLI share the same router/store semantics.

## Extension Boundaries

- Add fixed HTTP notification channels to `src/adapters/spec-channels.mjs` plus a fixture; use a code adapter only for token exchange or multi-step control flow.
- Keep the adapter contract `resolve(cfg) -> resolved` and `send(resolved, msg) -> Promise`.
- Inbound channels implement the shared contract and may expose optional action/question card methods; callers must always retain text/number fallbacks.
- Other plugins consume the injected `notifier` service and `dsh-notifier/sent` event; they must declare static injection and must not push from a sent-event handler.
- Future bidirectional channels must keep transport, control semantics, and native rendering separate. External SDKs are optional and lazy-loaded only after license, maintenance, security, and dependency review; unlicensed or `UNLICENSED` code is not copied.
